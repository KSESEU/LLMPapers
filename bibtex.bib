@string(DBLP:conf:acl:ChenZZK022="This paper proposes in-context tuning, which recasts task adaptation and prediction as a simple sequence prediction problem: to form the input sequence,  concatenate the task instruction, labeled in-context examples, and the target input to predict; to meta train the model to learn from in-context examples, finetune a PLM to predict the target label given the input sequence on a collection of tasks (very similar to MetaICL). On LAMA and BinaryClfs, the proposed method outperforms MAML.")

Specifically, the selection method first selects a small set of unlabeled examples iteratively and then labels them to serve as contexts for LLMs to predict the labels of the rest unlabeled data. The method selects the predictions with highest confidence (log probability of generation output) to fill up the selective annotation pool.")

(3) adding training objectives without diversity does not help,
(4) model performance improves when choosing similar templates for both self-supervised and downstream tasks,
(5) self-supervised  tasks and human-annotated datasets are complementary,

Experiments based on EvaLM prove that in-context learning can achieve higher performance with more demonstrations under many-shot instruction tuning (8k) and further extending the length of instructions (16k) can further improve the upper bound of scaling in-context  learning.")

@String(DBLP:journals:corr:abs-2212-10559="(1) 与The Dual Form of Neural Networks Revisited结合一起看，可以进一步理解in-context learning，通过与NN线性层对偶形式的类比，可以将ICL流程描述为：1. 基于Transformer的预训练语言模型作为元优化器；2. 通过正向计算，根据示范例子产生元梯度；3. 通过关注，将元梯度应用于原始语言模型，建立一个ICL模型；
(2)与Fine-tune类似，ICL也是在zero-shot learning参数的基础上，提供了一个更新量。")

@String(DBLP:conf:icml:IrieCS22="(1) 很有意思的一篇，回顾神经网络（NN）线性层Y=WX（省略偏置b）的原始形式与对偶形式，两种形式完全等价；
(2) 从对偶形式中可以发现，通过反向传播训练的NN线性层的输出主要是该层在训练期间的训练误差信号et的线性组合，其中权重是通过比较测试查询x和每个训练输入计算出来的；进一步可以得出，如果测试时输入的x和训练时的输入是正交的，那么梯度下降所得到的参数更新对于该样本x完全没有影响。")
